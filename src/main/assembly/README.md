Assembling your custom OpenIDM project
======================================

The zip.xml file in this folder instructs the maven assembly plugin to build your custom OpenIDM project, with all of the custom code, configuration, and resources you have specified that define your project along with the core OpenIDM server and whatever other external dependencies you have declare in the root pom.xml. See the comments within zip.xml for tips on specific changes you may be interested in making for your project.
